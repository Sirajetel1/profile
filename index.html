      <td>HTML tags were completely new, for example, the terms "p" "h" and few other letters were easy to figure it out, however, some were not simple. </td>
      <td>I was eager to learn and make sure I understand HTML. Towards the end of the day, HTML became clear and I was capable to read through the lines on the 2nd day.</td>
      <td>Problem-solving and keep on track with the details to avoid complexity as well organisation; in Hotmail, everything has to be in ordered and well structured</td>

      <th scope="row">CSS</th>
      <td>Understanding the purpose of CSS and the terms its used , it is completely different to HTML. CSS give colours or meaning to the page so everyone can follow your page. At the start was difficult to follow since most of the work was based on trial error, which is completely unique to me   </td>
      <td>Researching, persistent to look for a solution as well as creativity was applied during the week.  Multiple trials and errors were applied to reach the target , however, at the end the method was found.</td>
      <td>Since I gained the skills from HTML which is attention to detail, that helped to track and be persistent until I find the solution, trial and error has no formula or instructions to follow, its all about fault finding and solve</td>

      <th scope="row">Input</th>
      <td>Building an instagram front page was the time when I was seeking for similar concept to an input, I did not know , since I was not being showed how to do it , therefore, research is the only way to complet the task.</td>
      <td> Reseraching is one of my stregth, I had to look for box similar to instagram so you can put your details on , I looked for form at the begining and it guided me towards input. </td>
      <td>Researching  and being persistent to look for a solution. Creativity was applied during the week since multiple trials were applied to reach the target however at the end the style was found.</td>
